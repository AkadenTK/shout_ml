Another blocker, but this one uses machine learning to classify yells into one of eight classes:  Content, RMT, Merc, JP Merc, Chat, Selling (non-Merc), Buying (non-Merc), and Unknown.



Commands:
```
//sml h    -  help.
//sml t    -  set the minimum probability of belonging to a class to block.
//sml d    -  debug (show classification probabilities).
```
